1,Jurassic World Dominion - Official Trailer [HD],,sp7aut,13494,"0. Half of this looks like a Bourne/Mission Impossible film
1. If Alan doesn't struggle with his seatbelt in that helicopter, we riot.
2. Sam Neil will always be a babe
3. I enjoyed the trailer but can someone explain to me how apparently like 16 dinosaurs that escaped a mansion at the end of the last film have grown to the point of apparently being a threat to humanity in the space of what appears to be a handful of years at most?
4. Damn they are nostalgia baiting so hard.
5. The dialogue continues to be more scary than the dinosaurs.

2,Official poster for The Lost City (March 2022),,sp7t2o,1390,"0. This looks like an SNL skit, or a movie from Seinfeld.
1. This looks like a poster for a fake movie you'd see in a real movie.
2. This 100% looks like The Rock should be in it
3. Is that Brad Pitt?? He has a cameo?
4. They airbrushed the shit out of Sandra Bullock’s face
5. Is that Oscar from the office?

3,‘Kimi’ Review: Zoë Kravitz Excels in Steven Soderbergh’s Thriller for the Age of Isolation,,sp2uqz,2248,"0. I saw the trailer few days ago. I was hugely disappointed to learn that it was not about Kimi Raikkonen but some crime thriller.
1. Well this is surprising. Judging from the trailer, I thought the movie was going to be terrible.
2. ...where is all this hate for Zoë Kravitz coming from? I googled and didn't see any scandals or anything? I'm really confused.
3. Fantastic score from Cliff Martinez. Mix of a stringy homage to Bernard Herrmann and electronic stuff. Worked for me.
4. Good for her but Zoe Kravitz has been a charisma vacuum in everything I’ve seen her in, and the trailer for this looked really bad. I personally have zero interest in changing my mind off of one review.
5. It looks like Gen Zs *Blow Out*
